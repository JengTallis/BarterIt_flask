# BarterIt_flask
This is a barter site built with Python on Flask.

With the widespread usage of the internet for many tasks, e-commerce has become a popular form of commerce. However, although there are many well-developed online stores, we do not have a mature online platform that allows people to conveniently get rid of spare or unwanted items that could be used by others in the same neighborhood as well as to get desired goods or services in return, or to help others in their neighborhood with the skills they possess and be rewarded with desired goods or services, all without spending a penny. We propose a web application – BarterIt – to address this unfulfilled need, making online bartering of goods and services within a neighborhood convenient. 

BarterIt is a web application for an online C2C intra-neighborhood barter economy in which every deal is an exchange of bundles of items (money is not involved).
